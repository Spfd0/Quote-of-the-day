# Quote of the Day Website

This project is a retro-styled "Quote of the Day" website that displays programming-related jokes and quotes. It features a nostalgic Windows 95-inspired design with a pixelated font and a teal background.

## Features

1. **Daily Quote**: Displays a random programming joke or quote that changes every 24 hours.
2. **Countdown Timer**: Shows the time remaining until the next quote becomes available.
3. **Date and Time**: Displays the current date and time.
4. **Weather Information**: Shows simulated local weather data.
5. **Dark Mode Toggle**: Allows users to switch between light and dark themes.
6. **Responsive Design**: Adapts to different screen sizes for optimal viewing on various devices.

## Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript

## Setup and Usage

1. Clone the repository or download the HTML file.
2. Open the HTML file in a web browser.
3. The quote will automatically load and update every 24 hours.
4. Use the toggle switch in the top-right corner to switch between light and dark modes.

## Customization

- **Quotes**: You can modify the `quotes` array in the JavaScript section to add, remove, or change the available quotes.
- **Weather**: Replace the simulated weather data in the `displayLocalWeather()` function with actual weather API integration for real-time weather information.
